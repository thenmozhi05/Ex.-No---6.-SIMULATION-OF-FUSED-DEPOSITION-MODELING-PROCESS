# Ex. No. 6 - SIMULATION OF FUSED DEPOSITION MODELING PROCESS

## DATE: 22-11-23
## AIM:
### To simulate the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process.

## REQUIREMENTS:
### System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:
### STEP 1: Click on 'Base'. Base and Build Platform will be displayed on the left side of the screen.
### STEP 2: Click on 'Extruder' then extruder and extruder nozzle will be displayed.
### STEP 3: Click on 'Material Spool' then material spool will be shown.
### STEP 4: Click on 'Filament' then filament will be added.
### STEP 5: Click on 'Start Process' to begin the process.
### STEP 6: After the process is complete click on 'Stop Process' to view product generated using FDM process.

The base, often referred to as the "build platform," is the surface where the 3D printing process begins. It provides a foundation for the object being printed. The material adheres to this base during the printing process.
# Extruder:

The extruder is a critical part of the FDM 3D printer. It consists of a motor-driven gear that feeds filament (the material used for printing) into a heated nozzle. The nozzle melts the filament, and the molten material is extruded layer by layer to create the 3D object.
# Material Spool:

The filament, typically wound onto a spool, is the raw material used in FDM printing. The spool is mounted on the 3D printer, and the filament is fed from the spool to the extruder during the printing process.
# Filament:

Filament is the actual material used for printing. Common types include PLA (Polylactic Acid) and ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene). Filament comes in spools and is available in various colors and diameters. The choice of filament depends on the specific requirements of the print job.

Initiating the 3D printing process involves several steps:
Calibration: Ensure the printer is calibrated correctly to ensure accurate printing.
Bed Leveling: Make sure the build platform is level to ensure proper adhesion of the first layer.
Loading Filament: Insert the filament spool into the printer, feed the filament through the extruder, and make sure it reaches the hotend (the heated nozzle).
Printing Process:

Once the 3D printer is calibrated and the filament is loaded, the printing process begins:
Heating: The extruder and build platform are heated to the temperatures suitable for the chosen filament.
Layer-by-Layer Printing: The 3D printer moves the extruder in a controlled manner, depositing melted filament layer by layer to build the object according to the design.

Ending a print job involves a few steps:
Cooling: After the printing is complete, the hotend and build platform may cool down to allow for easier removal of the finished object.
Removing Object: Carefully remove the completed 3D print from the build platform. Some users may need to use tools or apply adhesion aids to facilitate removal.
Shutdown: Turn off the 3D printer.
